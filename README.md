## About Love at First Bite
Whether you're looking for love or just new people to hang out with, we are here for you! This app was built to bring people back together after the year we had in 2020. This app uses the Yelp API to find your favorite places to hang out. Users can then add them to their profile and connect with other individuals that have added that place to their favorites list.

## instructions

1. Log in 
2. Find your favorite spots to eat!
3. Add them to your profile.
4. Message other people that liked the same place.
5. Go have a great time!!
